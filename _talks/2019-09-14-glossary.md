title: De la polys√©mie en milieu hybride - a glossary to facilitate communication between developers and data scientists
conference: DjangoCong 2019
---

This short talk in French aims at highlighting in a fun way that many technical words are used both in data science and 
in web development, but with very different meanings - which can lead to misunderstanding when collaborating. 

It was delivered to an audience of Django web developers, with no experience in Machine Learning.
