# Who am I ?

I'm Sarah Diot-Girard. I've been working with Machine Learning and Python since 2012.

As part of my missions in successive companies, I've built my expertise in crafting meaningful ML
algorithms and models, focusing on how these models can easily be deployed in production.
I also have a strong interest in ethical and data privacy issues.

I attend and speak at local meetups and tech conferences, see the
[talks](/talks.html) section for details. I'm also an
[open source](/open-source.html) contributor.

I'm currently based in Poitiers, France.
