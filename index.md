# Who am I ?
{:.title}

I'm Sarah Diot-Girard. I've been a Machine-Learning Engineer since 2012.

Through different companies, I've built my expertise on crafting sane ML
algorithms and models, making sure these models can easily end up in production
and specializing around data privacy issues.

I attend and speak at local meetups and tech conferences, see the
[talks](/talks.html) section for details. I'm also an
[open source](/open-source.html) contributor.

I'm currently based in Poitiers, France. Also, I practice horseback archery at
international level.
