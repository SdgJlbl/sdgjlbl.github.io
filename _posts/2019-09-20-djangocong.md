title:  "Remote talk at the French DjangoCong"
---

I had the honor to give a remote talk at the [French Django conference](http://djangocong.org/2019/) on September 14. 

The audience was composed of Django web developers with no Machine Learning experience, and it was an interesting change 
from all the talks I made this year to promote software development best practices in the data science community. 

The slides are available [here](/talks/2019-09-14-glossary.html).

Thanks again to Jean-Michel Armand for inviting me to talk.
