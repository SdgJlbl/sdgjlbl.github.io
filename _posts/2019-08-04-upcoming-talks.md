title:  "Upcoming talks this fall"
---

I am very happy to have been accepted to speak at two great conferences this fall, 
the [EuroScipy](https://www.euroscipy.org/2019/) in Bilbao and the [PyConDE](https://de.pycon.org/) in Berlin. 
I will talk about two of my favourite topics, DataOps problematics with a talk on "Tests for Data Scientists",
explaining good practices from Software Engineering, at the EuroScipy; and a talk about "Data privacy in Natural Language
Processing" in Berlin.
