title:  "Productionising Machine Learning pipelines in practice, or how to increase your ML throughput in real life"
--- 

Putting Machine Learning models in production is something I talk a lot about, and I also discuss it with people from 
other companies at conferences, friends and former co-workers. While I am strongly convinced that there is a lot of values in 
having multi-disciplinary teams of data scientists, machine learning engineers and software engineers working closely together,
I am also aware that it is not always the optimal organisation.

In this blog post, I will try to summarize what is the ideal organisation for a team dedicated to using Machine Learning 
in a production setting, and we then will see what are some limitations of this way of doing things. Finally, I will list 
some pragmatic workarounds to make the best of what is, and not what should be.
